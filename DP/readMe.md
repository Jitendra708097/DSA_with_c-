**DP: Dynamic Programming** 

Introduction to Dynamic Programming:

Cycle of Dynamic Programming:
               
             move uppercase to base case              move base to uppercase
Recrusion ->   Top Down approach          ->          Bottom Up Approach       ->     Space Optimization
              (Recr+ memoization)                     (Tabulation)
